        JavaScript (/ˈdʒɑːvəskrɪpt/), often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that is one
         of the core technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS. As of 2022, 98% of 
         websites use JavaScript on the client side for webpage behavior, often incorporating third-p
         arty libraries. All major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on users' devices.
    </p>
        JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language that conforms to the ECMAScript
         standard.[10] It has dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. 
         It is multi-paradigm, supporting event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. 
         It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions,
          standard data structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM).
</p>
        The ECMAScript standard does not include any input/output (I/O), such as networking, storage, 
        or graphics facilities. In practice, the web browser or other runtime system provides JavaScript APIs for I/O.
</p>
        JavaScript engines were originally used only in web browsers, but are now core components of
         some servers and a variety of applications. The most popular runtime system for this usage is Node.js.
</p>
        Although Java and JavaScript are similar in name, syntax, and respective standard libraries, t
        he two languages are distinct and differ greatly in design.
